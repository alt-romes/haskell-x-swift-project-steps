This is the beginning of a repository in which every commit matches a step of an
in-depth guide into developing a native applications for Apple platforms (macOS,
iOS, etc.) using Haskell with Swift and SwiftUI.

The [first of the series of blog posts](https://alt-romes.github.io/posts/2023-11-10-creating-a-macos-app-with-haskell-and-swift.html) covers the set-up required to call
Haskell functions from Swift in an XCode project using SwiftUI.

In future installements of the series, I intend to at least discuss calling
functions with idiomatic Haskell types with Swift ones (both with and without
marshaling), SwiftUI observation, and iOS development which requires GHC to
produce code for the iOS compilation target.

I'm pursuing this project, blog post, and future iterations of this project in my
own free time. If you'd like to sponsor this project, visit [my GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/alt-romes).
